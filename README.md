# Veeso's Kitchen

Developed by Christian Visintin

This project is just a React website which I use to improve my React knowledge, to test libraries and for fun; and yeah, it's a recipe website which I've invented, since I like cooking.

## Requirements

- json-server <https://github.com/typicode/json-server>. Used to gather data for recipes and tweets
  - Start with `json-server --watch data/server-data.json`
